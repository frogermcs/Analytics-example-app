# Example analytics app

This is an example of a React application mostly generated by ChatGPT and Github Copilot. It was created to showcase the implementation of product analytics, which should give engineering teams basic knowledge about the products they build.

This project is part of materials from [Practical Engineering Management](https://www.practicalengineering.management/), where I help engineering leaders build empowered teams and maximize their influence in an organization.
